# Analysis 
https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/xmm-newton/sas-threads

Read "xmm_abc_guide.pdf" first(chapter 5&6).

Run "run_XMMproducts_spectra.py" to process the data, extract the light curve and spectra.

Run "lc_process.py"  to do light curve analysis.

(Make sure the code_2022 and lc_process.py is in the same parent directory!)


# Fit the spectra with model
Query "XspecManual.pdf" for help.

Follow the specturm-fitting process of the reference if it has done the specturm analysis.

Read xspec_abc.txt for detailed.

You can refer to the manuals (.pdf files in path like /Users/baotong/heasoft-6.27.2/spectral/help/) for the meaning of spectral model and their parameters.
